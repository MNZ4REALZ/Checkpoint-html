        Motorcycling New Zealand (MNZ) has a rich history that spans over a
        century. Originally formed in 1916 as the New Zealand Auto-Cycle Union,
        MNZ is one of the oldest sporting bodies in the country. Its first
        Annual Meeting took place on August 16, 1916, in Dannevirke. The
        organization‚Äôs founders included Gus Torstonson (the first President),
        H. Osgood (the first Secretary), and L. Lloyd (the first Treasurer).
        Affiliated clubs at the time included Palmerston North, Ashhurst Sports
        Club, Woodville, Napier, and Hamilton. MNZ has played a pivotal role in
        promoting motorcycle sport and supporting riders across New Zealand.
        Awards & Honors: New Zealand boasts an enviable record of producing
        world-class riders who have excelled on the international stage. MNZ
        owes a great debt to these talented individuals. The Roll of Honour,
        Hall of Fame, and Life Members reflect the organization‚Äôs commitment to
        recognizing outstanding contributions. Organizational Structure: MNZ
        operates under a strategic plan, guided by its constitution. The
        organization‚Äôs board allocates rider grants from the annual budget,
        supporting riders throughout the year. The 2024 Annual General Meeting
        will be held on May 26, 2024, at the James Cook Hotel Grand Chancellor
        in Wellington1. Remember, whether you‚Äôre a seasoned rider or just a
        banana enthusiast, MNZ welcomes all! üèçÔ∏èüçå
